#Hello I am Felix. This is my first Discord bot. 
#This bot works in coordination with benji7425's RSS feed bot, particularly for Youtube URL'S.
#Role settings are role id. To get role ID, ping your role in chat with \@ behind it.
#Pretext is the text you can set to display in the channel topic. Time follows afterward.

#Put your bot token here.
token = "tokenhere"

#Role that gets pinged.
roleone = "roleonehere"

#Second role that gets pinged(optional)
roletwo = "roletwohere"

#Third role that gets pinged(optional)
rolethree = "rolethreehere"

#The text for role one
pretextone = "pretextonehere"

#The text for role two
pretexttwo = "pretexttwohere"

#The text for role three
pretextthree = "pretexthreehere"
